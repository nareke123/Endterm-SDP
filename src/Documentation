This project is a product and shopping cart management system

Singleton Pattern (Cart):
    The Cart class implements the Singleton pattern,
    which ensures that only one instance of the shopping cart is created.
    Main methods:

Abstract Factory Pattern (Product and Factories)
    The Product interface and its implementations (Clothing, Electronics)
    create an abstraction for various types of products.

Decorator Pattern (ProductDecorator and DiscountDecorator)
    The Product Decorator class and its Discount Decorator extension implement the Decorator pattern.
    This pattern allows you to dynamically add additional functions to objects

Proxy Pattern (Payment and PaymentProxy)
    The Payment class is a real object for processing payments,
    and PaymentProxy controls access to this object.
    The proxy allows you to check whether the user is authenticated before making a payment.

Command Pattern (CartCommand, AddItemCommand, RemoveItemCommand)
    The Cat Command interface and its implementations (AddItemCommand, RemoveItemCommand) implement
    the Command pattern, which allows you to encapsulate the operations of adding and removing items in the cart.

Observer Pattern (Observer and ProductNotifier)
    The Observer interface and the Product Notifier class implement the Observer pattern. This pattern
    allows objects (observers) to receive notifications about changes in other objects (publishers).
